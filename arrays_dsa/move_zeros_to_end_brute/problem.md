in the given array of n elements containing both zeros and non-zero integers, move all the zeros to the end and display the new array.  
this is the brute force solution, time complexity is o(2n) and space complexity is o(x), where x is the size of temporary array created to store the non zero numbers.

# example:

[2,0,9,1,0,3] -> [2,9,1,3,0,0]
