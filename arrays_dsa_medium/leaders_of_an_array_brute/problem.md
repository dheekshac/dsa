an element in an array is said to be leader if there exists no element on the right side of it which is greater.  
from the given array of n elements, you need to find all the leaders of the array and return them.  
this is the brute force approach and the time complexity is O(n^2) and space complexity is O(1).
# example:
[10 22 12 3 0 6] -> [22 12 6]
