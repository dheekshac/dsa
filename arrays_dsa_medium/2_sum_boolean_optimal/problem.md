in a given array of n elements, and for the given value of sum of 2 numbers -> sum, find out whether there exist two elements in array such that their sum equals the given value of sum.  
this is the optimal solution with time complexity as O(n)+O(nlogn) (for sorting)  and space complexity as O(1).  we are not using a map datastructure in this.
# example:  
arr=[1,2,3,4,5] sum=5 -> true.
