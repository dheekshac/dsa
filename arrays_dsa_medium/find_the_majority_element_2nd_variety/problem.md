for a given array of n elements, re arrange the elements such that their orders are same as given in the array for a particular sign and  
all the elements must be arranged in alternative signs.  
if the number of positive elements is not equal to number of negatives, then the excess of elements of the sign that is majority must be placed in the end of the array. 
time complexity is : o(3n) , space complexity : o(n)
# example:
[1 -3 2 -4 -2 1 -2 -5 -8 1 ] -> [ 1 -3 2 -4 1 -2 1 -2 -5 -8 ]
